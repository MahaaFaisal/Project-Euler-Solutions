# Project-Euler-Solutions
Solutions to Project Euler problems in various programming languages, focusing on mathematical problem-solving and algorithm optimization.


Welcome to my collection of solutions for [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/), a series of challenging mathematical and computational problems.

## About

This repository contains my personal solutions to various Project Euler problems. Each solution is crafted to focus on:

- Efficient algorithms
- Mathematical problem-solving techniques
- Code optimization for performance

## Structure

Each problem is organized in a separate directory, named according to the problem number (e.g., `Problem_001`, `Problem_002`). Inside each directory, you will find:

- **Solution file**: A code file (e.g., `solution.cpp`, `solution.py`) containing the answer.
- **Explanation**: Some problems include an explanation of the approach and thought process behind the solution in a `README.md` file within the problem's folder.

## Prerequisites

To run the solutions, you need to have the appropriate programming language environments installed, such as:

- C++
- Python

## Running the solutions 
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-euler-solutions.git
2. Navigate to the problem folder and run the solution:
For C++:
      ```bash
   g++ solution.cpp -o solution
   ./solution
For python:
   ```bash
   python3 solution.py
